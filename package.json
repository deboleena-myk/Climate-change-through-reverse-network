  "description": "An NFT (non-fungible token) is data added to a file that creates a unique signature. It can be an image file, a song, a tweet, a text posted on a website, a physical item, and various other digital formats. This means that someone can own a digital file that it's marked with code to differentiate it from any digital replicas. Revise is a platform that lets you develop dynamic NFTs. They evolve over time. Based on the weather or based on how you interact with them.",
